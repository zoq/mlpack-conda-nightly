  summary: mlpack a fast, flexible machine learning library
  description: |
    mlpack is an intuitive, fast, and flexible C++ machine learning library
    with bindings to other languages. It is meant to be a machine learning analog
    to LAPACK, and aims to implement a wide array of machine learning methods and
    functions as a "swiss army knife" for machine learning researchers. In addition
    to its powerful C++ interface, mlpack also provides command-line programs and
    Python bindings.
